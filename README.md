Check out the [blog post](http://blog.staydecent.ca/entry/your-wordpress-theme) for an introduction.

### The Markup

Is simple, clean and tested. It's based off of my [HTML-Prototype](https://github.com/staydecent/HTML-Prototype) and encompasses my [Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Svkl4xhAnLDwVB2_eEGZ_uFHFABLt5to_ir6kiV44-E). The main goal was to make the markup easier to read and potentially replace compared to Twenty Ten (which is also a great theme starting point).

### functions.php

The backbone of your theme! Besides loading the utility functions, theme helpers and any specified Custom Post Types, the `functions.php` sets up all of the basic, and common theme options: post-thumbnails, feed links, custom backgrounds and headers and menus. It also specifies the attributes of excerpts, and contains the search form and comments markup (from twenty-ten).
